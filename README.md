**FNF Aikoyori's Gaming Mixes** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' that aims to add custom songs from various games plus the characters. New mechanics based on the games are also introduced.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.
